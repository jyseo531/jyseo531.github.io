Hi, Iâ€™m Jiyoung Seo, a masterâ€™s student in the Computer Vision Lab at **Korea University***(2025.03~)*. <br>
I received a B.S. in Statistics and Artificial Intelligence(Double-Major) from the **University of Seoul***(2021~2025)*. <br>

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I built a strong foundation in pattern recognition, computer vision, and 3D graphics, working on projects related to 3D reconstruction, inverse rendering, and low-level vision. <br>
Since July 2024, I have been working as an Undergrad research intern, involved in research projects. My ultimate goal is to become a top-tier researcher who drives innovation in computer vision and 3D graphics. <br>
