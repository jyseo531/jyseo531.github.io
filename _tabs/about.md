Hi, I'm a member of [Computer Vision Lab](https://kuaicv.com/) in **Korea University** *(March 2025~)*, provised by Prof. Sangpil Kim. <br>
I received a B.S. in Statistics and Artificial Intelligence(Double Major) from the **University of Seoul***(2021~2025)*. <br>

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I built a strong foundation in pattern recognition, computer vision, and 3D graphics, working on projects related to 3D reconstruction, inverse rendering, and low-level vision. <br>
Since July 2024, I have been working as an Undergrad research intern, involved in research projects. My ultimate goal is to become a top-tier researcher who drives innovation in computer vision and 3D graphics. <br>
